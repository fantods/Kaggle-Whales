## Kaggle Whale Identification Challenge

Data stored within `data/` directory, the data is available at https://www.kaggle.com/c/whale-categorization-playground/data

First attempt at this challenge using FastAI v1. Attempted to train classifier with the `new_whale` class included, which led to some overfitting and skew in the results.

TODO: Retrain on only known whales and do some final training with oversampled whales at the end.
